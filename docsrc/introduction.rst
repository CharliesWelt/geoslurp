An introduction to Geoslurp
===========================

**Geoslurp is a  pure-python module which allows downloading/updating  and querying of different datasets in a spatially aware database.**

When
The idea behind geoslurp is to develop a hybrid approach to store data (either as URL's or file links) and corresponding scientific meta information which goes beyond the obvious. Geoslurp therefore has several aims:
* Have a centralized access point to scientific data (but the data itself may be stored in disctributed ways)
* Allow advanced queries on the metainfo data (e.g. time and spatial queries, data specific queries)
* Provide ways to automatically download/update/register datasets
* Future ideas: Encourage reproducibility by registration of runs (e.g. store links to used datasets/queries and configuration scripts)
* REST-API to access from external
