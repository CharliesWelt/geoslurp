# Download and manage (geodetic) datasets with geoslurp
The idea is that this tool contains script to download/update commonly used datasets and to register them in a mongodb database. This database can then be queried allowing the retrieval of the relevant data or datafiles. 

Status: Experimental:
Downloading and registering GSHHG data seems to work now


## TODO
create a plugin for the podaac.jpl.nasa rest api? [see](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/ws)
