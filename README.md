# Download and manage datasets with geoslurp
The idea is that this tool contains script to download/update commonly used datasets and to register them in a postgresql+postgis database. This database can then be queried allowing the retrieval of the relevant data or datafiles. 

The main documentation lives at [wobbly.earth/geoslurp](https://wobbly.earth/geoslurp)
